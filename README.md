# Investigate a Dataset
# Overview
The goal of this project is to choose a dataset from the available choices and then go through the data analysis process. This project utilized the following Python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib. Finally, everything came together for conclusions. The specific dataset I use in this project is "No-show appointments". I analyze the data to see if any trends or correlations exist for why people in this missed (or didn't) their appointments.

This project was completed as part of [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) certification.

# Details
I have looked into the dataset and managed a few problems like unifying names, removing wrong data, adding new features based on existing data. I have also investigated most of independent variables in the dataset and made a few observations comparing them to each other as well as to the dependent one (no_show). As this was only an exploratory analysis, many potential correlations may remain uncovered. The data should be investigated further with more advanced statistical analysis to potentially reveal new insights and correlations.
